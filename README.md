# Check-in Behavior as a Proxy for Customer Satisfaction: A Causal Inference and Machine Learning Approach to Restaurant Success ü§ñüìçüìä

This study examines check-in behavior as a proxy for customer satisfaction in restaurant businesses by applying causal inference theory and predictive modeling with machine learning algorithms. The study proposes a theoretical framework, in which customer satisfaction is a latent mediator between predictors and check-in behavior, indicating indirect measurement of customer satisfaction through observable behavioral data. 

With Yelp dataset of restaurants in Saint Louis from January 2020 to December 2021, nine machine learning algorithms were implemented and tuned with customized hyperparameter settings for binary classification, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting, and Neural Network, to predict customer‚Äôs check-in behavior from static restaurant attributes, dynamic user-generated content, temporal patterns, and external weather conditions. Random Forest and Boosting are recognized as the most optimal models, with Random Forest algorithm demonstrating exceptional performance in targeting efficiency, whereas Boosting algorithm is particularly proficient for segment scoring capability. 

Causal interpretation from the variable analysis, with weekend timing, female reviewer participation and user-generated content variables are considered as the most influential predictors, are converted into actionable insights for restaurant owners, including controllable interventions, strategic interventions and weatherresponsive strategies to optimize customer satisfaction and business success.
